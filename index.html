        <li>In His name, there is power (shakti)</li>
        <li>In His name, there is peace (shanti)</li>
        <li>His name brings healing (changai)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This section emphasizes that everything a believer needs—spiritual or physical—is found in Jesus.

        <li>In His name, there is life (zindagi)</li>
        <li>In His name, there is worship and devotion (bandagi)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Jesus is not just a helper in times of trouble; He is the source of eternal life.
